# work-in-progress

## A list of metakgp supported projects that are still not mature enough to be released to the public.

If you are developing a project for KGP still in heavy development/ideation phase and want more contributors/visibility, please send in a PR adding your entry to the below table. Once you feel the project is feature-complete and well tested, you may inform the maintainers to allow transferring your repo to the org by indicating the status of your project. 

This list also serves as a good platform for first-time contributors to MetaKGP to find potential projects to contribute to.

| S.No | Project Name | Repo Link | Maintainer | Date created | Status(Ideation/Development/Feature Complete) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


## Guidelines for candidate projects (TODO - needs plenty of review and discussion with the community)

1. Must have a proper README briefly explaining the project details and what it aims to build. Also a CONTRIBUTING file for new contributors explaining steps to contribute is needed(optional?)
